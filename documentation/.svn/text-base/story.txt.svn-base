Food (The burger)
The burger isn't really the issue.

The main issue is the drink, and the HFCS can't actually feed the body so people eat as much even with the HFCS.

So it isn't actually an issue with cheap food.  The bigger issue is actually stress.  Sugar + carbonation is a great way to settle a stomach that is overstressed. 

 So it is more that the poor are using a cheap stress reliever that makes them fat
