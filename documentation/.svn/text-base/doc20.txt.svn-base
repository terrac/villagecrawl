1 sell one is going before chopping wood (should do after)
#2 trading for the second set of gold seems to just do an additional put rather than an add
3 look more into the display item on trades
4 make too taxed people leave and remove their buildings(rather than just die)
  a get the move store position and delete the gate
  b also remove all farms within a certain radius
  
  
  
1 goal?
  a make profitable trades
  b put down some buildings
1 individual stories using the different elements
  a a quest where you can choose to be fair or harsh.  If you choose fairness you have a 30% chance of things turning out alright
    if you choose harsh it is a 60% chance of turning out ok

1 make each race like certain types (like say merfolk don't like dairy, orcs don't like books)
  a this makes for additional logic in trading
    1 not trading certain items
    2 providing extra money for others
    3 seeking out the best matched items





1 look more at deals -> indicators of price (and think about fuzzying the value a little (like 4-6) instead of 4 5 or 6


#2 destitution
3 stories woven in (including country)


1 make the background trades advantage the itemshop (and have a constant that lets money be more valuable than goods)
  a make the itemshop just take money (and become destitute and leave if none)
  b make individual farms take money from the farmer as well (and become destitute if none)  
     1 vparam
     2 run through all the people
     3 subtract X amount of money
     4 if money is 0 change the clothing to rags/remove
     5 if this is the itemshop person pop up a you lose alert (and throw a lose execption)
     
  c make the buildings you drop down only sell goods (sometimes they might sell above or below market prices)

1 think about the idea of crashes


#1 haggle needs to actually add on accept
#2 make formula be like 60% above and 40% below


#1 put each building with its parameters
#2 then the haggle
3 get the specific effects from the image page
4 test
5 merc and country


#1 algo to move the effects/buildings down and fill in any spaces


1 structure haggling / items + those random events you can press
  #a put tcr into the vparams map and call on runbefore throug that
  #b create a mapdata with the runbefore
  (simplemd just add runbefore
  c decide on random types with effect that get created in a certain order (and for now they might just log or something)
  d over time things are given in relation to things
  e this will be a base one
  haggle->20%
  building->20%
  merc->20%
  country->20%  (these are constantly filled, but occasionally moved over time)
2 test adding the touch to gcanvas and reducing the map size for mobile  
  
  
  
  
  
  

#make the trade take in a null value to replace debt for now

#1 fix the item amounts (they are doubling somewhere probably on sellone (the background trade thing
#  a check this some more
2 balance (so that haggle comes every so often and if you have done well you can accept on the first offer, but you do not have to)  
  a the special effects that deploy random events (and allow you to do extra)

3 interest over time (add more features as time goes on to make things more interesting, but initially just put it out with this) 
  ( the other docs after this)
  
  



1 sell one by choice (to make supply lines important)

























1 playing
  a each person sells and keeps their own internal money
  b you can put down banks and borrow money (in addition to a set amount to start with)
  c focus on the addition of other countries personalities (for example austerity vs growth)
    and how it alters your strategies

1 interest in playing
  a haggle trades are rare
  b building should be relatively complex
  c mercs and places for them to go (only one at a time)
1 debug config thing

#1 constrain haggle by the amount of value in gilgamesh's items (money first)
  #a make items have a total value method
  #b create a subtractmoneyandthenitems method
  #c check initial amount and do a bong if no good
  #d check new amount and same
  #e if successful call the subtractitemsandmoney method
  #f get l.owned = itemshop and use that person
  #g test
2 add more buildings
3 rework the level up give buildings thing
4 decide on the item types being influenced by events
  
1 work on mercernaries and scenarios for that  



1 organize items so that you only see the top 8

#1 fix farms

#1 make sell work more frequently (maybe 100% of the time)
#2 make itemdisplay display 2 down and then move horizontally
 # 1



#1 reduce radius
#2 make woodcutter not use farms
#3 figure out why itemsdisplay is not being run
#4 wheat image fix

#1 item display to html with images
#2  recheck normal haggle to test (and make sure the things bought can be resold)
#3 make sure normal background sales increase gold
4 background sales increase amount on the number of people on the map
5 resource gathering people can move through each other
6 there can be marketplaces that act as intermediaries for the people
#7 their resource gathering is altered to be directly created by them (and they only have a few, but those few are productive
8 the background trade is altered from picking an item to repeatedly pick items till the amount they have to spend is satisfied

1 hiring mercenaries
  a they come like normal traders
  b they give an option to hire them for a specific quest
  c your local guards can also do the same, but you can equip those
  d eventually add obstacles that these can engage in as well to give the map some danger
  
1 add kingdom gold
2 recheck normal haggle to test (and make sure the things bought can be resold)
3 make sure normal background sales increase gold
4 make sure that people sales go to the itemshop (ie the kingdom's gold)
5 on traderoute add taxes 
  a (the taxes are based on the number of farms and the general level of the buildings)
  b taxes happen like background trades
6 if taxes cannot be paid the kings soldiers go around and destroy farms until they are satisfied 
  a a tax man comes
  b gold goes negative
  c soldiers come and destroy farms, reducing negative number
  

1 secondary buildings have a smaller radius but higher value items and the ability to convert items
2 barns have a big radius.  It gets bigger by subtracting the farmer's wealth as they sell.

1 add a vinyard that directly produces wine.
#2 wheat goes to beer or bread



1 general overlays for sellitem
2 costs
3 sell item only sells to people who don't have a certain amount of that item already (for woodcutter)



1 make barns have a bigger radius (2) than bakery and a count of 5
2 make bakery have a count of 1


1 work on making sure the right number of buildings come (ie smooth it out by changing the randomness based on the count)





#1 sell item takes the culture itemname->building name and tries to sell
#2 fill map with personality (ie mountains, rocky areas, and lush areas around water)


#1 add the random % fire chance to templates
2 add trade item to trade for specific things based on the culture

#1 do sell to itemshop
#  a take current items
#  b 
2 do bakery gets from itemshop or barn

#1 debug resource gather

1 do interactions
  a add hunter
    1 animals appear often with maybe a bias towards water
    2 wolves can attack
    3 hunter goes after dangerous and safe animals
  b add doctor
    1 sickness is working
    2 doctor heals
    3 doctor also heals guards
  c add guard, 
    1 bandits are like animals, but no safe ones (generally will just rob, but might attack traders, make the traders naked after)
    2 only guards attack bandits
    3 
1 woodmaker - "gather resources"
  #a pulls from culturelists a type
  #b moves to each spot for 5 turns and waits
  

#1 barn makes wheat and milk
#2 cheesemaker/bakery both pull items from barns, or itemshop if available
3 all of them also sell to the itemshop depending
4 then look at haggle with types
5 more layered interactions
6 quests and such that change all that

1 make the building people trade with itemshop and nearby (buildings have compatible types)
  a add search nearby for buildings with associated properties
  b if a person is on them trade with that person
1 make haggle affect the selling value of every item ( with a type compatibility determining the amount for each (could be positive or negative, but mostly positive)
  a selling value is based on item
  b haggle's % and types get saved in game.culture.haggle

1 think about each action and representation associated with the different things as well as the item connections
  a all buildings -> woodcutter ( need wood to repair buildings)
  b bakery -> wheat on barn
  c beermaker - > wheat on barn
  d blacksmith -> woodcutter(or mined coal)/traded or mined minerals
  e miner - > goes to each rock within a radius and mines it
  f barn -> farms have specific things in relation to specific tiles similar too miner 
1 play to increased items to level 3 (on tablet) (make sure haggle works)

1 then add in some other choices maybe



#1 remove the water stuff right now
2

#1 add starting items to seller
#2 add the "addbuilding" logic to background trade

#1 test with a single barn
2 replace gdp with items and gold
  a trades trade based on items and gold
3 make sure the random chance on trade gives an associated building (but only a 60% chance of doing that
  and not a random one)
4 test with barns    

1 people come in and automatically buy extra
  a this gives a random chance of the next level of things to be given as a building
  b extra is defined as more than 5 + rand 4 of something  
  #c trade item to buy item ( sell to background trade)
  d add in template
  e on template add a runafter on buy item that has a %chance of adding a building based on the level
  
1 map with ground in the center
  a nothing is dirt
  b grass is under

1 barns (with both wheat/meat/cheese))
  a templates have a random chance of executing (if no random 100%, otherwise % of 100)
  #b trade items trades with central character  (sellitem)
2 woodcutter
  a cuts on trees
  b (eventually trees grow back)
  c (eventually repairs need to be made)
  d trades with central character
3 the rest get initial items like food/wood/water on a regular basis  

1 inner buildings have very few additional parts (like a radius of 1 would be pretty large and a radius of 0 might be normal
  a a small house instead of a farm

1 indirect choices create place 
  a put down builder, it influences things
  b more analytical things, but put behind choices
    1 roads
    2 etc
1 events
  a put in stairs down
  b have people occasionally come in and go down the stairs
  c much more infrequently have them come up and make comments
  d do an event where some characters are chasing a bandit and will kill him/her if they come up
  e do a priest expidition
  f sludge elf thing
  g and so on related to the game

1 dwarf + armor
2 merfolk + trident
3 orc + orc armor

1 each race has its own armor (and weapon) list
2 they also have an item list (but they can also pull from generic items)
3 race specific lines
  a in the name of begoh this is too low a price
