5 tower defense

1 to get things started
  a graphics

      to the total money the person has
    2 make each one shoot out a random distance
    3 add in a cha ching sound
    4 then make them all converge on the score and move it up appropriately (each image represents a percent of the total
  b tutorial
    1 initial trade window with initial tutorial (explaining the basic goals of trading)
    2 add a note that you can only place houses in the main area (and only display appropriate items for appropriate maps)
    X as trading expands add more here
  c interesting items
    #1 create generic type images if none is provided (check none by creating prefetch)
    2 give all generic items a bacstory that fits with the area of the game (ie no robe, robe of province XXXX)
    X (more later on)          
  d tower defense

2 trade gameplay
  a add several up and down % buttons (very high, high, medium, low, rock bottom)
  b can buy and sell from the market (market has a list of items)
  c people will come through with specific desires (ie cooking implement, book, food, armor, etc)
  d the specific desires will cause them to pay more and the towns reputation goes up or down based on availablity
  e holding onto interesting items in the market will cause the fame of the town to go up 
  f fame brings in more valuable items and possibly more and different kinds of people
  e different levels of fame will bring in different levels of items (and different ones)
  g fame is general and there are also specific faction fame (like kobolds and humans)
  h the faction fame can be altered by say offering a book counter to a specific factions propaganda
  i or offering them an item insulting to their religion
  g (this would be covered by specific types associated with the items


5 tower defense element 
  a on attack an alarm gets sounded
  b monsters try to steal the trading market  
  c each person tries to go into a trade building and each building has a different attack (maybe not trade buildings)
  d equipment helps somehow, maybe?  Like they add bonuses to the person and so does the building.
  e trade buildings subtract from the trading market
  
6 phone usability
  a trade random builds a list of things to trade
    1 inventory for kobold
    2 inventory for person
    3 inventory for market
  b trade random sets a trade item on one side
  c then you can set an additional item to barter or leave for money
  d you can also set a price from really high to really low (depending on how much you want it vs how much they want it

  #b create a canvas
  #c draw the image with appropriate scaling
  d if special big exists then call it
  e otherwise just call the generic type big
