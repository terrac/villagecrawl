1 add body that posts needs to the personal economy with the right position
2 add spouse and children in monster entrance
  a create a template that monster entrance uses
  b there are the base monsters with a name
  c then seperately there are the combinations (ie family, trading party,bandits, solo)
  d the base monster is chosen and then the combination builds off of that (basically its just like the class system, a list of extra classes to be added to individual monsters)
  
3 give them needs that make them and the other character farm
 # a need to farm
 # b farming drops a seed 
#  c it attaches them to the runturns.  The seeds have a slightly random germination time and a random chance of turning into a fruit 
#  (additionally add some needs like sewing/etc/ to make a complex system for trade)  
#4 add the farming part to the goblin lair
#5 add the repeating need to farm
