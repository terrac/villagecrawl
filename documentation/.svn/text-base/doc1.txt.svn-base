1 economy as heirarchy
2 base impulses are registered by an outside "body" component
3 needs/actions/modifiers
4 initially needs will be determined by base impulses and the "society" economy
5 various events register their needs in the society economy
6 placing an unbuilt gateway puts up the need to build it
7 once the building gets built (or before and the modifers simply aren't ready) then the modifers will see that the base impulse actions like sleeping/eating can be satisfied
and they will start being called
8 additionally there will be a need to farm based on the number of people available (and other food sources)
9 there will be a need to trade based on how many creatures walk by 
10 there will be a need to guard that is fixed
11 over time there might be a training trait that the modifiers take into account
