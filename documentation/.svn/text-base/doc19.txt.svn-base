1 fillneed goes to random with the amount controlling the random
2 fillneed tries to push towards the values society/team/personal
3 the less social the more personal

1 choice 
       a set to jerk and builder
       b set to builder and jerk
       c on both add both things
2 then the after stuff
       a on one of the stats
       b do a hiring action that hires similar things
       
1 initial choices, sets the team to be either builder/jerk
2 then those offer more similar choices to further specialize
3 and they have direct control over that line

1 work directly through the issues
  a for each one do some specific testing first as you go through
2  




1 you get both, but the choice chooses the side they are on
  a you also get differences based on that
2 minor complaints - uses the complaints
3 engineer - farms naturally atrophy, engineers go around and prevent that
4 jerk - talks bad about others behind their back and to their face, can ask to get rid of them in certain cases
5 arrogant - 
6 anti social - very few common social actions (ie making a friend 
7 interferes with others - goes around and actually increases the atrophy of farms
8 highly social - more than average (tries to get people together, haggles with random people)
9 funny stories - (begin a story in chat, up nearby happiness
10 woo - occasionally yells out WOOO, 
11 leader - 
12 incompetent - 1 less radius

story game (radius starts at 4) (inherits from culture and uses methods from it)
1 initially you are given a breadmaker
2 then bob the beermaker comes in through trading
3 then a choice between a tannery or a bookmaker (someone wants to choose one or the other)
5 then a guardhouse comes 
4 then a bookmaker/tannery quest (bookmaker wants to print something risque/the guard wants to go off and fight some bandits) 
  if the guard wins you get a few extra trades due to safer trade routes and the occasional comment by merchants
6 an animal attacks
7 then a doctors house comes
8 sickness strikes someone
9 more choices about buildings (and at this point the happiness/other stats start being visibly affected by the placement and choices you have made)
10 some quest associated with the amount of the buildings you choose
