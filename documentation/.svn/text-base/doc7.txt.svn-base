#1 finish up consume.  
#2 add need algo to economy.  Priority rules everything around me
#3 trade
   a make trade use money and reject favor in the case of outsiders
   b check consume, check trade, make sure trade's move is working
4 guard protection money ( guard creates 200 turns of protection values that it trades because its value of those things
is zero.  But each family only trades for one)
   a make guard visit each gate with a portal on it, in order preferrably (ie make a list per map and only reset once that maps list is
     done
5 merchant trade
  a merchant goes out and offers favors or money for food and other created items
    1 trade (food,unique)
  b merchant displays in store
  c monsters come by to trade (they have personal economies that have food needs/clothing needs/travel needs and they
  also have a need to get back on the road)
  d some might have a brigand need
6 expanded trade items
  a incoming monsters have lots of different items from around the world
  b locals have unique items.  Like unique herbs, cultural items, weapons, texts, etc
  c and the two get traded with an option to set the different amounts to trade for (like a graph

7 meaningful goals
  a occasional attacks.  You organize to defend in various ways
  b occasional droughts.  You keep food stores high.
  c occasional diseases.  You keep clean and don't put the diseased out in front trading (or you get lower trade from 
  the outside cause they think of you as a diseased place)
  d you can do things to promote yourself as a trading town (merchants looking for unique goods come)
  e you can promote yourself as a farming town (merchants looking for sizable amounts of food come more often)
  d you can promote yourself as a military outpost (you can establish higher taxes if you are keeping the merchants safe)
  e you can create tourist attractions (all sorts of neat things)
