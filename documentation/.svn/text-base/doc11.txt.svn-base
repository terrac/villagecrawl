1 create a visual indicator to show that there is more to see (ideas)
  #a draw right arrows 1 past the end
  #b figure out how to add into the process so that the arrows don't disappear (draw whenever the cache isn't set rather than on the variable)
2 really valuable items that have an interesting history

4 monsterpersoncreation then starts creating the moving monsters
  a first just create additional generic people who help and stay if there is enough room
    1 make sure there are enough templates that are continually useful
      or to make some general ones that get taken when there is no use
    2 add a template that basically amounts to "leave" that gets taken if 
      there is a continual lack of use
    3   
      
    10 the template does the same basic actions as recruitable, but for sleep if there isn't an 
      available permanent bed ( if no bed then fall asleep and leave the next day)
  $b then just create monsters that ignore the town and exit
  c then create monsters that attack the town (they can pillage)
  d add in trade with a timed gui interface that allows you to make
    the choice on how much
  a readd back in hunger


1 make the create monsters set the attack template

2 make the symbolic map cycle through the people and the image for the symbolic map

3 upload game to website, make video (including placing down an additional gateway and having them build)



5 add a job that moves to the center (start it with -1 priority )

6 readd back in traits and stories so you have very individualized units





2 make the monster entrance pull in various creatures (recruitable/attacking/trading/moving through) give names


  g need a guard 
  d the different trading/enemies need to come through  
  h need to balance things so that the enemies coming through can be defeated
    have a guard shout item (place it and the guard goes to it, shouts and gathers all the adults to him/her
    defeating the enemy is mainly a matter of pulling back hurt people and having better equipment
    enemies leave items

  a thirst still doesn't yield back to something else


  b singing and dancing should be preceded by moving to a central area
    singing should have a singing icon
    dancing should move back and forth and have a dancing icon
  c building is probably too slow
  


  f need a jeweler/potter/tanner/etc (should be able to place items on houses and have them be built)
    tanner = leather
    jeweler = rings
    potter = pots (storing food and water, so don't have to move away as often)
    baker = bread (storing food, using wheat)

  
2
 e building needs to reward with items
