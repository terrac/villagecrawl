#2 food area doesn't need to be built
3 make jobs dynamic 
  a some go to build first
  b but they only stick with jobs that do something.  They only occasionally revsit the currently unnecessary ones 
    1  save the turn that the job starts on the need
    2  if the turn is within 10 or 20 maybe then put that need back on the end of the need list with a marker saying "not needed"
    3  if all for the current state are not needed then pull from the wrong state (like singing and dancing)
4 extra steps for building food (like with acorns, put in cloth, put in river, wait, take out)
5 jeweler / potter / etc
  a jeweler mines in the resource area off of the extra area, goes to blacksmith,waits so long, makes a jewel
  b potter goes to mudpit and then to kiln, waits so long and makes a pot
