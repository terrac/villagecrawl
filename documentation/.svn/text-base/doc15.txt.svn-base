mention 3 things thinking about next (graphics, work more on item identification and preferences, add in a tower defense element)
1tower defense to start with
  a during hour 2 a person is created who goes to the market and tries to steal something and return
  b people move inside buildings and fire on person



2 item preferences
3 graphics
4 identification of items

4 mark certain items as money
  a the money pops out graphically on a successful sale and goes to the other side
    1 might have a "pickpocket/swindle" feature that allows you to grab some of that money as it flies out
    2 it is smaller than the items(maybe?, mugiht put a size feature)
  b the items pop out graphically as well and go to the other side  
  c anything can be money
  d the money is calculated and auto traded on an unbalanced trade
4a trade method for money
  a swap already has calculated the extra trade amount 
  b if positive then runs through the seller's inventory and pulls out enough money to trade
  c if negative then the reverse
  d given the value type adds an extra % amount
  e if the cpu has the appropriate need for the type then pop up an accepted graphic
  f calculate the extra money needed if arny
  g pull out the items and put them into image graphics and send them out and onto their way.
  
5 several layers of identification on items
  a you or the cpu can sell unidentified items for a certain price    
  b there is a "seer hut" (house with an eyeball) to go to and identify items
  c the seer hut has a chance of getting visitors
  d if someone is manning it as a priest there is a chance of identification when an outsider comes by
  e the identified items could be cursed
  f unidentified items cannot be used
  
6 an inn that takes in visitors and charges money (but also needs a steady supply of resources and food to maintain a quality level)

7 for the dancing and singing it should be a minigame of some sort that is a visual representation of the current status of the
  village.  The minigame more or less is the ability to make certain people show themselves off
