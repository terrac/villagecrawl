(About me section)
About me - I have 4 years professional experience in software development.  I am creating this game to express my ideas on AI, to make sure I stay skilled at programming,
and to hopefully make some extra spending money.  (My first goal is to get a computer that can run my game at a reasonable speed in GWT development mode)

My goal with this game is to make it easy to create simple games (along with creating my own games of course).  For example you could take the current archer
template and make it unable to move.  You could take the general template and have it create enemies that don't have any attacks (who only gave the goal of carrying
off trophies, and then create a loss condition where you lose when all your trophies are off the map.

Then you could take the existing game I created.  Add some basic stuff to it and have a tower defense game.  You probably still couldn't do it if you are just an artist.
But you probably could ask a programmer to take 10 hours or so to do the basics and then do the rest from there.

That is the goal behind the game.

My daughter put something in my wii.  Now the cd part of it no longer works.  I bought shiren the wanderer and let her stuff it in there only to find out that
it is pretty much broken.  My cd has a few scratches on it, but it is probably still playable.
No warranty on the wii though.  I am debating sending it back to nintendo to get it repaired.  If it does then how will I watch netflix?  I really don't want to
buy xbox gold or use my computer (watching hulu through the hdmi cable is annoying enough)
