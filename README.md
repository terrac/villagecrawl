# villagecrawl

 It has the following features. It is built through a series of json objects that are mapped to java objects.  The game state can be saved by saving those objects back to json.  It has a rpg mode.  The main current part I am working on is similar to a real time version of civilization, but with the main control being the ability to drop “cards” down to alter the behavior of autonomous villages.  Used the NOSQL library Objectify.
