1 start off with initial techs.
2 rules that allow techs to increase over time, and for the necessity of
  interaction to increase different techs
  a techs start at one and by default follow the formula of large early gains and less later
    (use efficency formula created)
  b techs increment over time to +1 for every era assuming the right state
    (first is fishing vs hunting, second is trading vs conflict, third is agriculture vs hunting)
  c cross polination increases states
    (on conflict or trade when available do cross poliniation)
3 up till agriculture and then bronze age
  those start to show subtle differences and colorful people

#1 remove sucess hunting and make fishing limited (with gathering on failure)
2 put currently researched tech (at least the type) in an overlay on the person
3 on successfull researched do the popup
4 expand out the states so that it is difficult for a single population to do all the techs
   a hunting states
   b fishing states
5 add on trade and conflict the chance to transfer some research if there is a large lack on
  one side
  
  

1 create a tech under hunting called follow the herd which requires a minimum amount of hunting
  and then can be researched.
  It says "if a successful hunt, then next fishing chance is ignored
  

1 in genera preferences have a thing for how fast the techs research (by default fast)
2 techs give a chance of different preferences with some having a high variablity like hunting or fishing.
3 combat can destroy a group

1 tech maxes and mins are defined with a random component
  a on increment when creating a new tech do a + or minus 3 random
  
2

1 increment random tech and display a popup on a successful tech
2 make the techs each increase a stat or change something
  a barter creates trade spots which people occasionally visit
  b jewelry,pigments,etc put down places where items can be mined/created
  c other things create lists of items that can be traded and alter statistics
  d on a trade/combat the crappier culture gets a tech boost.
3 make sure huntingvs fishing and etc work
4 

1 make the growth function quickly at the beginning and then have great difficulty 
 #approaching the split point
  #pop/maxpop = inefficency
  #growth=growth -inefficency * growth 
  
2 make sure that fishing can only hit fish and hunting cannot 
3 see exactly why combat isn't happening 

4 add second era (with appropriate fanfaire
5 remove the ok box for clicking on a unit and make sure that clicks can follow people
  (eventually a small box will appear graphically showing what is going on with those people, periodically refreshed)
  

#1 single tech with right properties will go up or down
#  (this never stops and is associated with the state)
#2 other techs will randomly increment
  (create an explanation bar that follows the person and shows you their techs
3 techs add items
4 adding fish to show good fishing spots

1 initially the key techs are picked and reinforced (or not, if they fail)
2 other techs move up by a gradual progression (one is picked and it gradually goes up, and these go up faster by tech transfers)

The people go through the different eras with bonuses based on the techs and a richer world than currently (disease, more animals, etc)
for example on preserved meat hunting/fishing produces lasting food that gets eaten and boosts the pop
all of those techs simply increase over time and are reinforcing 
a new era happens when all the previous techs are fully researched

1 a few key techs that can alternate and have wide ranging effects (so you might have 30 hunting and 10 fishing or 39 fishing and 1 hunting
  a hunting
  b fishing ( add fish in and have their populations deplete/increase, otherwise fishing yields are low like gathering)
                         (on the invention of agriculture hunting can become sheperding and fishing can become farming)
  a combat (chance of fighting when close)
  b trade ( when close it shows two gold icons instead of swords and item amounts change hands
  
  
  a liberalization (removed restrictions
  b fundamentalism (added restrictions that stop disease and have slight negatives on productivity)
  
2 general technologies that simply grow over time



1 freeze 3 techs
2 run 180 turns.  If split or higher pop then keep frozen and freeze 3 more (if none available then just pick some)
3 if the time for an era to come has passed then move to the next era on the freeze choice 

1 add religious techs	

1 basically techs allow for long term changes to individuals
  a long term hunting/gathering for the initial era
  b second era has the beginnings of trade (including seeking out areas to resource gather and trade
  c then more items to trade
  d domesticated dog (and each era is gradually entered into, and represented by clicking)
2 agriculture
  a eventually the agricultural society forms in fertile areas
  b it spreads as tech improves
  c fundamentalism vs liberalism become big things and the initial tribal religon changes
3 copper
4 bronze age
5 iron age
6 ancient history    


4 test the incrementing of technologies
  a break structure into era and state (the techs all go into a map, but there is a structure with the names)
  a break out incrementing further (hunting is its own state, in addition to general)
  b create a mapped relation that allows the correct randomness
5 the era logic for enabling new techs for people (transferring is seperate)


1 share latest
  a add the ability to rename and add a description for the shared
  b put the shared at the bottom of the gamelist
  
2 push current big map up
3 put the pincrement for hunting into a tech and push it up, test different amounts
  and an additional option of avoiding completely killing a population 
  
6  
  
2 add two societal tech trees
  a fundamentalism
  b tribalism
  fundamentalism has a list of techs from the bible
  tribalism has a list of techs from the shinto religion (look at old tech rule)
  
  use the big world map to add the different areas (some which have different animals
  diseases and so on)  fundamental techs all promote disease resistance.  tribal techs
  promote a general cross section of techs (combat fighting and avoiding it, organized society,
  planning ahead, etc).  The fundamental techs do too, but just to a lesser extent with
  disease resistance becoming a huge factor.
    a swampy area in the middle (patches of swamp and grass)
    b grassy at the bottom
    c desert at the top (with isolated grassy in the northwest and a river in the northeast)
    snakes,alligators are in the swampy area (they respawn low health if killed off and 
    gain health in the swampy area, but also alligators can hunt sheep if nearby, snakes
    just kill anything that comes close)
    sheep roam all over
    elephants and lions roam too.  (elephants are basically too tough to be hurt and aren't 
    hunted by anything, lions hunt the sheep and fight with the humans
    
    humans eventually learn how to domesticate sheep.  this gives them a random chance
    of getting various diseases and makes hunting less necessary.
    When a human is diseased it puts itself into a disease state and starts
    losing people and incrementing (or researching new) disease techs
    on interactions between people (combat and otherwise) disease gets spread and
    sticks with a population.
    
    tribalism is bad about combat and grudges, forgiveness is a tech that can replace
    tribalisms combat ideals and it allows further growth
    
    eras are goverend by their own properties (like the amount of time it takes before an
    era can be researched, and maybe other requrirements

Develop a simulation that shows how people define their society in reaction to their environment.

1 inital approach for testing
  a take code in google drive and run it 
  b replace new code till you see issue


#1 write some code that puts techs on each person
#2 make conflict tech
#3 add in only currently used techs
#add increment tech logic
5 ma
4 test

each population has a list of techs which have a chance of increasing when related
actions occur (or just in general there is a random tech that has a small chance of
being created and added, or upgraded)

if a tech is enabled that means that the person starts with it

On the addition of barter and pigments start creating visually unique looks for each
person (start with it added by default to test)

1 goals
  a cultural affectations associated with techs that demonstrate spreading techs
    1 handaxe,spear,dress 
  b a variety of foods, gathering that picks them, and animals that go after one food
  

2 wire the techs up to affect the game in various ways 
  (not all have to be realistic, some aren't really techs, 
  but might be natural disasters or afflictions  


#1 add list of techs in a seperate json data that has the technology key
#  a then test that by running them 
  

1 gui actually only allows changes in technologies (enable,disable,change value)
  techs then run constantly
  a technologies are in a pbase with their name
  b run through all the techs and turn them into a list
  c tapping on the list will pop up something that takes the tech
    values and allows you to edit them
  
2 add some variation in the relative amount of the wheat produced on grass tiles
  so that only some grass tiles will get it  

3 create all the techs, make them individually gained over time and shared,
  try out all the possible combinations
#1 huge version


1 basic actions are there.  Technology only changes the chance of them
 occurring

#1 fishing,gathering,hunting, put overlays on them
2 add random fruits as a part of gathering

#1 add in a property that will make the human not go after the sheep on a certain
#  percentage basis and pick a different one if the health is low
#2 just sheep  (just add a number for sheep and people)
#3 gathering tech
#4 fishing tech
  #a move near water
  #b increase food
  
5 pretty edit is a link
  a add a json data that is a list of buttons/textboxes/etc with name of the variable
    the code recursively searches and finds the variable  and displays it
    on edit you take that list, edit them with the new values and then export
  b there is a buildprettyedit that holds the list of objects that correspond
  c   

1 add in gathering tech (seperate so we can see both)
2 add in fishing tech
3 


1 add in the first tier of techs
  a for each step share a game
  b think about descriptions and names for the game


#1 add a link that posts to leaderboard to share 

#1 create leaderboard and assoc tech
2

1 play with statistics and choices until I have a solid beginning
  a choice between several maps (of differing sizes)
  b


#1 install tortoise svn and continue updating unfuddle (look at old laptop if necessary)


4 offer a link to play the game (and have a share link)

1 use phonegap to deliver first android app
  a take initial stats and allow people to change them and watch the resulting simulation
  b create web frontend with a dozen stats
  c post those stats to the website
  d on start run that game
  e offer a way to share the game on facebook (to start just have a link)
1 try making the space a lot bigger

make the base oobject pick from a list of techs given a random amount for each one
starting techs (eventually add the ability to gain new ones)
1 stick technology (hold stick in hands,greater combat ability)
2 fishing 1 (empty hands, stay near water)
3 hunting (follow cows)
4 gathering (gather food with edible by human trait,move towards that food)
5 fiber (skirts)


#2 slow growth down a lot (like to 1000)
3 wolves that hunt cows and will fight humans if they get too close
4 snakes




1 when technology is developed or transferred create an associated cultural item
2 on split keep the cultural item
3 on potential combat vs trade higher when more culture


1 tech tree
  a based on initial config
  b choices occur inside and are probably just superficial
  c
2 huge base
  a create africa symbolic map
  b each


1 adding back in conflict
  a check to see alignment of culture/tech tree
  b if different and if next to another then
  c do the sword and reduce both populations


1 create action that is breaking nuts
  a move to tree
  b flash the trading image on the person
  
2 hunt animal action
  a on create internal have it randomly create some animals that randomly move around
  b add hunt animal action onto a template

3 action that prepares leather (gathers animal hides, turns it into leather
  a hunt animal
  b change clothing to leather
  
4 action that carves spear
  a go to tree
  b flash trading image
  c add a spear
  
5 fiber
  a go to grass
  b flash trading image
  c extra clothes  


6 fishing 
  a extra food near water
  b use code that makes some water on coastal things (fishing generator)
  c equip spear, move next to water, flash trading image
  
7 huts
  a move to spot
  b flash trading image
  c set down a hut
  
8 cooking
    (after hunt or gather)
  a call fire action
  b next to fire flash a meat action    

9 preserved meats
   a cooking takes longer
   b leftover meat rots slower
10 ritual burial
   a add in small chance of death
   b put a ritual around it (the dancing)
11 modern language
   a add in required techs for other techs
12 barter
   a trade routes start to occur on overmap
   b random chance of person coming in and trading with the designated merchant
   c people can make choices about that barter
  
13 pigments
   a new resource is revealed on map
   b code to make sure new resources are chased after
   c each new resource is tied to a color, clothing colors are tied to that
   d making action for dying clotihng
14 jewelry
   a new resources are revealed on map (next to ocean)
   b new resource + fiber offers jewelry
   c jewelry gets traded (lightweight and high value)
15 music
   a every so often a flute gets created
   b when signing or dancing occurs (random chance) flute music is added
16 slavery
   a increased chance of battle
   b battles are less deadly
   c slaves are traded like any other resource
                 
                 
                 
1 fundamentalism vs liberalism
  a fundamentalism is a technology
    1 fundamentalism increases in response to negative events
    2 it adds a lot of secondary technologies that can be negative or positive
      depending on the situation (disease,conflict, losing in general)
    3 so fundamentalism will end up in outlying areas where the losers of battles go   
  b so is liberalism
    1 liberalism increases over time
    2 it removes fundamentalist rules
    3 so the cities where the winners of the conflict are will be full of liberalism
  c both will wax and wain constantly in response to conflict, disease, and other events            
                 
                  
#1 foodrule
2 a peoplerule that creates the group of people with the right technologies
  to start with
  a it sets all of the templates and actions
  b neither group has any technologies to start with
  c the starting technology also governs the gathering of future techs
    1 there are incremental future techs (ie spear to spear + 10)
      they are gotten over time
    2 there are techs that require the right place, or the right techs
    3 the techs tell the early story of technology growth  
3   

3 one group of people chase after herds and develop technology for doing so, 
  a create some LBs that move next to the cow and then reduce its population
  b they also devote some % of time to gathering
4 the other group of people stay and develop technology near a river for farming.
 Growth is directly goverened by food and if there isn't enough then 
 conflict occurs, the losers split off and try to take over one of the
  smaller in between population groups 
  (they directly fight those and the two merge together and share culture.
   Then these hybrid cultures eventually take over due to advantages in 
   culture and so on and so forth. technology growth occurs mainly in the 
   high population focused areas



basic ideas: 
1 landrule that fills the land with food 
  a every square gets some food (dependent on tile+ little random)
  b if food is above X amount then an image is shown for it
2(also creates migrating herds), 
  a randomly pick spots to place cows
  b those cows search 1 extra tile for food and pick the most 90% of the time
  c

1 start, people with nothing
  a growth+fiber adds some clothing growth+farming adds sickle
  b conflict+ spear adds spear , conflict + armor adds armor
  c initially start out expansionary
  d an initial technology controls 
  

1 story, progression towards cities
  a beer technology leads to a tiny village at 30 growth
     1 which leads to bread technology (growth)
     2 and prostitution (the ability to convert some wild people when they pass nearby)
     3 and bigger cities near rivers (river based techs)
        
  b herding technology allows mobile populations to grow
     1 but it can be transferred to cities
     2 herding leads to disease technologies
         a which depending on disease resistance and culture can wipe out populations
           1 and that leads to disease resistance being increased
           2 and an additional chance of disease resistant techs being adopted
               a fundamentalism (basically techs are rarely given up)
                  1 downside is that not all good techs will be adopted
                  2 upside is that disease resisntant techs have a greater chance
                    (cleanlieness,not eating certain foods, xenophobia, banning prostitution, banning gay sex)
  b fishing technology allows populations to grow extra near mouths of rivers             
  c liberalism ( technologies are frequently given up to make more room)
    1         

  d populations transfer people and start to gain identites
    1 one city might have a lot of growth-conflict populations (grow, seek conflict)
    2 there are a few populations that simply avoid all others (low growth technologies, no city tech)
    3 some cities might have a lot of growth-expand and a few conflict
  e city techs start becoming based off of specific acquired resources
  
1 self reinforcing behavior 
  a techs that control behavior
    1 seek out conflict (look one tile ahead and go towards)
    2 seek out growth (ie stay on good tiles)
      a additionally activate growth technologies
    3 avoid others (look one tile ahead and go the other way)
    4 (these can combine so that you might have one that seeks out conflict, then seeks out growth
    
  b techs that can be tied to other technologies
    1 a tech has a chance of creating a third technology that contains
      two techs (and is appropriately named tech1-tech2)


3 slow things down a little to watch

#1 on splitting split one tech off to only one group
2 on conflict a tech has a small chance of being transferred
3 put in more shinto techs and make sure that that makes the assortment more random
4 visual representation of technologies
agriculture
5 liberalism promotes freedom type techs
6 fundamentalism promotes rule type techs
7 city based techs vastly increase wealth and so on, but are more dependent and can fall apart
8 the progression to higher cities should be randomly adding techs that sometimes work together and sometimes don't
  with many failed cities along the way ( including events that disrupt things) so for example you have
  a dozen populations in a mutually benificial relationship, one of them gets disrupted in its tech
  and then they all fall apart


#Culture have 5 main technology slots
The technology slots then influence behavior (fishing for example tend to move along the water)
                                             (strong technologies encourgage fighting)
                                             (growth technologies encourage growth)
                                            (there might be a favor desert tech for example)
                                             
#the number of each technology then gets constantly reported on the side
#  a add code to clear out the tech every iteration
#  b 
Choices on clicking allow you to influence those technology slots
Each cultural technology gets represented differently when going into an area
                                             
Technologies are explained from the perspective of the tribal people in words and voices when clicked on
They are also reactive random technologies get added or changed over time and become more useful
for example disease gets more potent with liberalism and population, fundamentalism then has a protective
effect.  The best way to describe it is that guns germs and steel describe why the west won.  This
describes the ebb and flow.  The creation of cities, the creation of complex technologies and the
backwards slide when disease hits or things change.  Liberalism's weakness is its lack of rules leads
to negative technologies having an uncontrolled effect.  Fundamentalism's is that it keeps on adding
rules until the negative rules destroy the society.  (you have other things like machiveli's the pursuit of power)

1 start representing different cultural technologies
2 add in some choices

if population more than 1 add in a question "should we fight?" and they fight and then the results are
reported

1 pick one trait and make them all similar for each population

1 different clothing, different populations
2 initial hunt/gather templates (and then move off)
3 village 

do this while working on stuff

1 randomly add a technology every 100 turns to a population

1 put technologies into the different rule parts
  a total pop
  b growth
  c conflict
  d every x turns it build up statistics for that pop-
    each one gets called off of the population to do the appropriate actions
    
  
 
2 replace the different spots with technology
3 do the random generated builder


The different parts of building a 2d game in GWT. Loading images, writing to the canvas, adding in small visual cues, and other general issues with building a game in Java.

Current story
  a starts out one hunter gatherer
  b population grows, populations split at about 20 people
    a default technology of shaman that bands together 
    b technology grabs each % technology of population and then updates the growth amount (this happens every 10 turns)
    
  c each good technology adds a little to the total amount and slightly alters behavior
    1 add 10 positive technologies and 5 negative ones(they already exist and will increase or decrease in percent and have the resulting effects)
    2 add fundamentalism vs liberalism technologies
    3 add in a question that speaks to fundamentalism or liberalism
    
    
  d dramatic increase in population on advent of agriculture
  e cities and towns and the associated specialization.


Impermanent technology
  a all technologies are a double.
  b a certain amount either go up or down based on the current trajectory of the population
  c events can cause major shifts
  d major technologies guide the trajectory (fundamentalism increases things like aversion to homosexuality
    and give those technologies some of their power)

Conflict
  a add more negative technologies
  b make technologies mostly impermanent and on a percentage base.
  c 
  the conflict comes from which technology you have to prioritize.  When you click on a population
  it will give you a choice to respond to a series of events.  If you choose to then that population
  will prioritize those technologies and will compete against the other populations, but also merge
  with them.  When you watch them they should grow and alter according to the culture you have
  given them.  
  The second idea for conflict is that the first one is too rewarding.  The second one will be all about
  properly managing people.  You will have crises that test your social reaction and those will
  simply hurt the populace if you do badly on them.  For example your child acts out, you discipline 
  them or you don't depending on the situation.  You are given a leadership role and you decide how
  controlling you want to be.  You act in an unfair way giving your family an advantage
  basically negative technologies can be developed, can be gained after a disaster, or just over time.
  By going in and handling those situations you maintain the populations and provide for a more helping
  hand.
  

1 technology
  a technology changes increase the total growth ability for 

1 make population set a marker for different pops (name + counter on pop which gets set to all lbs
2 make the clothing one set different clothing
  a randomly assign some pieces of clothing to a specific population (eventually tie with images)

2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
  a if fishing tech is researched the fishing template is added
  b put some animals down
  c put some fruits down
  d look for the gathering action, assign it to some
  e look for hunting action
  
  

5 add in code that gives a random chance of a scenario occurring
1 movement,growth, etc are all based on the tech tree


#1 use a method that clears out the htmlout to display the new stuff
#2 test and iterate







1 test some more and identify errors
2 



1 add in code to make population add people
2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
3 add in code to set the clothing
4 make sure fishing works correctly
5 




1 goal is hundreds of random scenarios of unusual situations
2 based on nonstandard myths and dungeon crawl images
3 (initially random with maybe a few choices and chances, can do a tech tree later)


1 on click create a fmd at 0,1
  a take what is in the hmd and create the FMD
  b it is created through the selection thing (with maybe additional changes depending on the gate)
  c clicking on the town
  d make it so that both the town and the person are written

2 technology introduces more complicated interactions

1 lower the initial growth rate and max pop to encourage dividing

1 tall symbolic map of africa
2 growth/conflict/etc work off of it
3 on clicking a tile create the fmd and only run the currently clicked one (if already exists remove the map part and recreate)


1 conflict has a small chance of creating a city given the circumstances
  a conflict holds a create city rule (to start with it is just internal)
  b if the population is at max run
  c if the amount created is max then create no more and go on
  d if next to water then 10% chance (and can't be too near another city)
  e on creation add a city capacity under the total pop key to nearby tiles
  
2 add extra movement when not near a city, essentially making those pops nomadic  
  
  
3 Alter growth rule
  a basically some changes to growth based on randomness and events
  b if population in tile then small chance of reducing growth
  c if below normal growth and no population small chance of increasing growth (and this could be changed by tech)
    

1 cities have a high total pop limit
2 everywhere else doesn't
3 low amounts of pop outside of cities and frequent moving

1 when a conflict occurs show it, if it is clicked on create
  a scene of the two sides fighting
2 clicking on the city will show the city and have options appear
  (trades, and choices, doing well will speed growth, poorly will slow growth)
  
3 otherwise clicking on a tile with a small population will show a couple
 farms
 (though you could specialized the pops and have other scenes appear
