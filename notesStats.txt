1 story, progression towards cities
  a beer technology leads to a tiny village at 30 growth
     1 which leads to bread technology (growth)
     2 and prostitution (the ability to convert some wild people when they pass nearby)
     3 and bigger cities near rivers (river based techs)
        
  b herding technology allows mobile populations to grow
     1 but it can be transferred to cities
     2 herding leads to disease technologies
         a which depending on disease resistance and culture can wipe out populations
           1 and that leads to disease resistance being increased
           2 and an additional chance of disease resistant techs being adopted
               a fundamentalism (basically techs are rarely given up)
                  1 downside is that not all good techs will be adopted
                  2 upside is that disease resisntant techs have a greater chance
                    (cleanlieness,not eating certain foods, xenophobia, banning prostitution, banning gay sex)
  b fishing technology allows populations to grow extra near mouths of rivers             
  c liberalism ( technologies are frequently given up to make more room)
    1         

  d populations transfer people and start to gain identites
    1 one city might have a lot of growth-conflict populations (grow, seek conflict)
    2 there are a few populations that simply avoid all others (low growth technologies, no city tech)
    3 some cities might have a lot of growth-expand and a few conflict
  e city techs start becoming based off of specific acquired resources
  
1 self reinforcing behavior 
  a techs that control behavior
    1 seek out conflict (look one tile ahead and go towards)
    2 seek out growth (ie stay on good tiles)
      a additionally activate growth technologies
    3 avoid others (look one tile ahead and go the other way)
    4 (these can combine so that you might have one that seeks out conflict, then seeks out growth
    
  b techs that can be tied to other technologies
    1 a tech has a chance of creating a third technology that contains
      two techs (and is appropriately named tech1-tech2)


3 slow things down a little to watch

#1 on splitting split one tech off to only one group
2 on conflict a tech has a small chance of being transferred
3 put in more shinto techs and make sure that that makes the assortment more random
4 visual representation of technologies
agriculture
5 liberalism promotes freedom type techs
6 fundamentalism promotes rule type techs
7 city based techs vastly increase wealth and so on, but are more dependent and can fall apart
8 the progression to higher cities should be randomly adding techs that sometimes work together and sometimes don't
  with many failed cities along the way ( including events that disrupt things) so for example you have
  a dozen populations in a mutually benificial relationship, one of them gets disrupted in its tech
  and then they all fall apart


#Culture have 5 main technology slots
The technology slots then influence behavior (fishing for example tend to move along the water)
                                             (strong technologies encourgage fighting)
                                             (growth technologies encourage growth)
                                            (there might be a favor desert tech for example)
                                             
#the number of each technology then gets constantly reported on the side
#  a add code to clear out the tech every iteration
#  b 
Choices on clicking allow you to influence those technology slots
Each cultural technology gets represented differently when going into an area
                                             
Technologies are explained from the perspective of the tribal people in words and voices when clicked on
They are also reactive random technologies get added or changed over time and become more useful
for example disease gets more potent with liberalism and population, fundamentalism then has a protective
effect.  The best way to describe it is that guns germs and steel describe why the west won.  This
describes the ebb and flow.  The creation of cities, the creation of complex technologies and the
backwards slide when disease hits or things change.  Liberalism's weakness is its lack of rules leads
to negative technologies having an uncontrolled effect.  Fundamentalism's is that it keeps on adding
rules until the negative rules destroy the society.  (you have other things like machiveli's the pursuit of power)

1 start representing different cultural technologies
2 add in some choices

if population more than 1 add in a question "should we fight?" and they fight and then the results are
reported

1 pick one trait and make them all similar for each population

1 different clothing, different populations
2 initial hunt/gather templates (and then move off)
3 village 

do this while working on stuff

1 randomly add a technology every 100 turns to a population

1 put technologies into the different rule parts
  a total pop
  b growth
  c conflict
  d every x turns it build up statistics for that pop-
    each one gets called off of the population to do the appropriate actions
    
  
 
2 replace the different spots with technology
3 do the random generated builder

Current story
  a starts out one hunter gatherer
  b population grows, populations split at about 20 people
    a default technology of shaman that bands together 
    b technology grabs each % technology of population and then updates the growth amount (this happens every 10 turns)
    
  c each good technology adds a little to the total amount and slightly alters behavior
    1 add 10 positive technologies and 5 negative ones(they already exist and will increase or decrease in percent and have the resulting effects)
    2 add fundamentalism vs liberalism technologies
    3 add in a question that speaks to fundamentalism or liberalism
    
    
  d dramatic increase in population on advent of agriculture
  e cities and towns and the associated specialization.


Impermanent technology
  a all technologies are a double.
  b a certain amount either go up or down based on the current trajectory of the population
  c events can cause major shifts
  d major technologies guide the trajectory (fundamentalism increases things like aversion to homosexuality
    and give those technologies some of their power)

Conflict
  a add more negative technologies
  b make technologies mostly impermanent and on a percentage base.
  c 
  the conflict comes from which technology you have to prioritize.  When you click on a population
  it will give you a choice to respond to a series of events.  If you choose to then that population
  will prioritize those technologies and will compete against the other populations, but also merge
  with them.  When you watch them they should grow and alter according to the culture you have
  given them.  
  The second idea for conflict is that the first one is too rewarding.  The second one will be all about
  properly managing people.  You will have crises that test your social reaction and those will
  simply hurt the populace if you do badly on them.  For example your child acts out, you discipline 
  them or you don't depending on the situation.  You are given a leadership role and you decide how
  controlling you want to be.  You act in an unfair way giving your family an advantage
  basically negative technologies can be developed, can be gained after a disaster, or just over time.
  By going in and handling those situations you maintain the populations and provide for a more helping
  hand.
  

1 technology
  a technology changes increase the total growth ability for 

1 make population set a marker for different pops (name + counter on pop which gets set to all lbs
2 make the clothing one set different clothing
  a randomly assign some pieces of clothing to a specific population (eventually tie with images)

2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
  a if fishing tech is researched the fishing template is added
  b put some animals down
  c put some fruits down
  d look for the gathering action, assign it to some
  e look for hunting action
  
  

5 add in code that gives a random chance of a scenario occurring
1 movement,growth, etc are all based on the tech tree


#1 use a method that clears out the htmlout to display the new stuff
#2 test and iterate







1 test some more and identify errors
2 



1 add in code to make population add people
2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
3 add in code to set the clothing
4 make sure fishing works correctly
5 




1 goal is hundreds of random scenarios of unusual situations
2 based on nonstandard myths and dungeon crawl images
3 (initially random with maybe a few choices and chances, can do a tech tree later)


1 on click create a fmd at 0,1
  a take what is in the hmd and create the FMD
  b it is created through the selection thing (with maybe additional changes depending on the gate)
  c clicking on the town
  d make it so that both the town and the person are written

2 technology introduces more complicated interactions

1 lower the initial growth rate and max pop to encourage dividing

1 tall symbolic map of africa
2 growth/conflict/etc work off of it
3 on clicking a tile create the fmd and only run the currently clicked one (if already exists remove the map part and recreate)


1 conflict has a small chance of creating a city given the circumstances
  a conflict holds a create city rule (to start with it is just internal)
  b if the population is at max run
  c if the amount created is max then create no more and go on
  d if next to water then 10% chance (and can't be too near another city)
  e on creation add a city capacity under the total pop key to nearby tiles
  
2 add extra movement when not near a city, essentially making those pops nomadic  
  
  
3 Alter growth rule
  a basically some changes to growth based on randomness and events
  b if population in tile then small chance of reducing growth
  c if below normal growth and no population small chance of increasing growth (and this could be changed by tech)
    

1 cities have a high total pop limit
2 everywhere else doesn't
3 low amounts of pop outside of cities and frequent moving

1 when a conflict occurs show it, if it is clicked on create
  a scene of the two sides fighting
2 clicking on the city will show the city and have options appear
  (trades, and choices, doing well will speed growth, poorly will slow growth)
  
3 otherwise clicking on a tile with a small population will show a couple
 farms
 (though you could specialized the pops and have other scenes appear
