  f fundamentalism/liberalism
    a fundamentalism boosts war/population/disease resistance/etc, but without a hated enemy
      it causes massive internal conflicts (mystical quest is an elderly counter to that)
    b liberalism reduces internal conflicts    


1 basically you have a large list of leaders with associated stats that make them
  approach the world in different ways
  a some differ on conflict
  b some have unique cultural attributes
  c some have unique conflict techs 
  d the basic goal is to build out the pieces so that I can pull the rest along
  
1 incremental tech
  a gets placed onto an incremental tech list and that increments all the villages techs
  b 

1 for the combat stuff just have the 10% difference be evident in the combat check

#1 move leaders to a central area to pull from so that they can spread to new villages
2 disasters
  #a add a disaster story that occasionally strikes, it just kills people and says a flood occurred
  #b make it control its own popping up and be relatively rare
  c make sure that it combined with fighting can destroy villages

1 techs
  agriculture (incremental)
  d pottery
    plus to total pop
  e shepherd
    plus to total pop, disease
  a copper
    plus to combat/pop, needs mining for later increments
  b tin
    plus to combat/pop, needs mining for later increments
  c bronze (writing, sword, chariot)
    plus to combat/pop, needs both tin and bronze, has attributes to form
    a long mining chain to gather
  (all sorts of items eventually, have popup for button after clicking on)
  iron
  (comparison table for techs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history)
  urban/rural

1 trade story (A moves to b and spreads culture)
 #a each leader starts at 100% culture
 #b each spread spreads 5%
 #c each new village starts at 50%
#2 overlay display culture (pick 3 colors and use them as images (it changes on 51%, and can change later)
3 change fighting chances to go through a central function and to use culture (100% and 100% would mean a 2% chance of fighting)
  a if a fight successfully goes through then the person who has less culture gets that culture completely wiped out
  
4 techs that happen over time and alter behavior
5 disasters
6 disease (ideally a lot like techs)

#1 take destruct village logic and make sure it checks for village

1 put down 3 villages
  a just 
2 have 3 preselected cultures be set for them on start
3 one has +10 to conflict, another has -10 to conflict, and another has normal conflict
 (montezuma, ghandi, washington)
4 add a trade tech, a person is sent back and forth to villages within a certain radius
5 trade adds a cultural influence, whoever has 51% is in control of the village
  (warriors of seame culture, and villages have a vastly reduced chance of fighting
6 do fundamentalism  vs liberalism and the incremental techs
7 test until you can clearly watch cultures fight and gain advantage.
8 more maps
9 disease, disasterY   


1 initial tech adds agriculture 100% to all villages


  

1 fundamentalism vs liberalism (fundamenatlism is disease resistance and population boom, liberalism is incremental tech increases)
2 have some long term techs that are incremental and boost with liberalism

1 fun comes after additional cultural technologies
  a it is more about crafting your cultures, setting them against each other
    and then seeing the result
  b it has historical elements, but is not historical
  i
1 fun, play historical scenarios by choosing your technologies
  a for example play the jomons, being invaded by the chinese
  b or roman culture (with a tech that enforces culture and takes taxes)
  c or the adoption of copper and long tail civilizations
  d pick some random civ and do a scenario with slavery
  e the scenario ends and you get a score
  f also the tribal jewish culture (in various stories)
  

1 put tech on time with appropriate time amount
2 when time executes then 
  add larger forces tech to a single village, whenever a person loses
  in combat then it has a chance of adding on that tech (but not if it is an 
  optional tech and they have a different option, smaller forces might be a tech too)
  Attack weak points will do more overall damage, but less damage to young men this will
  boost the retalitory aspect by increasing conflict in the damaged tribe (by having a higher young men %
  the hatred should attack based on conflict % and conflict % should be based on young men in
  age 
1 maybe larger forces, or have attackers be more generally damaging (or have those as techs)
(larger forces, attack weak points as first two technologies)
put the list of techs in the display list (villages stay relatively similar, most different ones
stay on top)

2 random disasters and diseases

3 put an age on villages and maybe have some color to show that

1 
1st, damage and village dissolution

1 conflict stat,fertility stat, disease resistance stat
  basically the current random values are influenced by these stats.  These stats
  are influenced by the current population as well
  so high amount of young men boosts the conflict stat above the base conflict stat
  (which means killing/dying needs to alter the gender demographics) 
  high amount of young women boosts fertility stat, old people reduce both stats
  then techs are introduced that would subtly alter behavior, and conflict is changed to
  win or lose based on these stats (also a village might simply disband if it gets too small)
  what all that means is that you could introduce a technology and it could alter the balance of power
  so a specific village gets a stone tool or a religious practice and it uses that to dominate in conflicts
  through superior numbers or fighting ability
  the cities then display their logs and their tech lists (as a pop up)
  the tech lists will alter the clothing to make things more interesting.
  so for example a religious practice of food for the dead would protect against disaster (basically
  when disaster is implemented it would reduce the food supply which would increase conflict and cause lots of issues
  then the religious tech "food for the dead" gets added to one tribe and that tribe has a slight decrease to fertility,
  but when a disaster hits it doesn't suffer nearly as much internal conflict due to the traditionally wasted food

1 on demographic have a list of diseases, include current pop resistance in stats
2 run through disease and have it cause demographic changes based on properties
3 current pop resistance does not copy over on cloning

1 have a list of technologies and maybe a % adoption
  a
  
1 stories and responses
  (keep a log of each village, tell complicated stories in the different
   random chances that can happen  
#1 interplay between cities set of stories
#  a do fighting, make the young men on mystical quests have a chance to fight if they are on an existing village
#  b that village could be destroyed or taken over
#  c alternatively if it wins then the young men are destroyed (or potentially just driven out)
#  d create hatreds and wars that come out of this fighting
  
2 Add onto the quest an ability to spread disease (diseases are added like technologies, and spread like technologies
  a diseases will have an infectiousness, and a death rate or side effects
  b diseases with high infectiousness will burn themselves out due to resistance (infection breeds resistance, at 100% infection becomes impossible
    so if there is a 40% infection rate then within 3 years the village will be 100% resistant and stop the disease, but every death reduces 
    resistance rate.  A high death rate has its own affects
3 Technology
  a technologies are added at a certain time to a random village
  b when a person meets a village without the tech it can potentially spread it
  c lots of techs, and techs      

1 do mystical ending that ends in successfull village (restricting saying no village can be within 2 of another)
2 boost stories to make that overtake the area


1 change notifications to log (log identifies the town)
2 the mystical quest log starts with 3 endings, complete death, potential death and failure or success
  success is defined by a random amount that says "a village was founded
3 migratory patterns on villages and surrounding areas
  a villages have age, but also migration which naturally puts some population in the surrounding area
  b it puts more  

1 drastically reduce chance of story being hit
2 work through the scenarios in mystical quest (have direct colonization and then women migrating over


1 basic stories complete
  a make it so that the world is populated (though some will be hermit pops, others will be farms)
  b create stories about the interplay between cities (conflict)
  c then move on and see

2 disasters and disease (for example you might want to have a zombie outbreak disease
3 technology progression (where it becomes really interesting)

1 aggressive story, elderly story, fertility story
2 split story, etc on stories, add additional demographics







1 do 3 points (and the chart has 3 points
2 age changes the % infant/child/young adult/adult/middle age/elderly
3 (age has a method that takes a range and then converts to % based on the range and number)
4 (the chart changes slowly, but for debugging purposes I'll just output a string list)
5 


1 write a few basic stories
2 run with map to see how it works
3 expand stories and do a nice demographic window.











1 statistical civ 3
  a fork the project on bitbucket (move the current code onto github eventually)
  b strip out all code, try to simplify to 20 classes to start with
  c duplicate long movement, add short movement, make configurable from describing starting civs
  d (4 civs to start with, that are isolated (potentially across continents)
  e they have different traits and abilities that are selectable and then they aquire
    diseases and technologies over time (once a year has been reached there is a small %
    chance of them getting it and conflict can also spread technology or diseases)
  f so to start with you might have a montezuma civ that has a sacrificial trait.  For them
    that means they dont take slaves, they are compelled to conflict
      another might have slave taking that would mean that they boost their size through conflict
      but they get the demographic of % slaves with associated problems and solutions (slave
      takers have a large chance to gain new technologies, but they can occasionally get the
      "wrong" types of slavery, if they gain heritage based slavery they have increased internal
      conflict.  If they have general slavery then their chance of gaining new technologies
      through time is reduced
  g a big part of this is the growth and decline of civilizations.  Once a civilization 
    turns into a farm then that is the central farm that controls an area with a leader
    it can expand, it can move its base due to events (conflict, climate change), and
    some techs can spawn new similar bases.
  h the hunter gathereres just gradually expand everywhere (based on a trait or tech that
    is optional and have a small range.        
      

1 demographics
  a each age with a number is saved, also a % gender
  b move each number up one age and call a set of random chances for each age
  c for example 14-40 potentially will create a baby
  d men age 14-25 will increase agression in purportion to size
  e combat kills mostly young men and causes special events
(For demographics create a static object that works on PBases and then put it
 on the time method, for now just work on creating the demographics and viewing
 when clicked)

1 time rule
  a make sure that you can do increments in less than a year
2 spread rule (disease,technology) 
  a actions initiate spread on action (add spread command)
  
1 write a function that ages a population a year given a set of demographics and a set
  of technologies
  a in time rule write a method that takes each lb on the map, gets its population
    and inrements
  b incrementing saves the population size, compares it to last, and if it is larger or
    smaller it applies the appropriate demographic shifting
  c to start with (if the .demographic doesn't exist) create a normal distribution of
    20% children, 40% young adults, 40% middle age, and 20% elderly
  d this distribution will be sets of exact numbers for people incremented yearly
    (ie all numbers shift up 1)
  e in any given year 30% of young adults have children, increased or decreased by size changes
    and other factors
  f large size reductions by default take from young men, but current diseases alter that
      
      
2 write a function that runs over the population sets and sets a % for technologies
  a each farm has the potential of becoming a cultural center 
  b when a new technology is introduced one farm now spreads that technology to anything next
    to it
  c other contacts in between people also spread technology (along with disease and whatever)  
  
3 take the previous technologies and describe how they would be useful in this situation
  (candles lead to belief in soul)
4 create a layer that shows the demographcs of the populations,and that shows the strength of 
  the technologies
  
5 write a series of scenarios that take the population to the bronze age    

technologies are reinforced due to closeness to a center (or due to warfare/death)
They should dynamically show how groups form

Each person represents a group of people
They are guided by the cycle of history and events
(IE instead of growth it has a set of people with a set of techs which affect that growth
and the demographics of that tribe
so a youth heavy demographic would primarily be about violence 
an elderly demographic would be conservative and weak
middle would be middle
male dominated (like a tech that influences gender, or violence directed at one gender
) would affect things too
conflict primarily kills men, disease kills liberal personalities
liberal demographics are more prone to agressive things, fundamental to avoidance

The point of all of this is to see a tribe/civ and watch it interact with the world



1 technology philosophies
 a technologies influence people (and the gameplay is regulated enough to notice
 b no interactions with techs.  They are created, they spread, and they show
   descriptive stuff
 c the fun comes from creating a map or viewing other's maps
 d interactions might be choosing major things (like ritual sacrifice)  



1 make sure totalsize doesn't go to 1000 for leaders (so they keep their health bar)
2 make leader's chance of attacking nomads smaller but not nonexistant

Simulation tells a story
a it gives data about how long lasting each person is
b it gives statistics on different things
c it provides the ability to add in certain "techs" that affect things







3 simple playable game in the simulation
  a interesting text when clicking on a unit
  b clicking pauses and clicking when not on a unit unpauses (to make clicking on units easier)
  c liberalism vs fundamentalism
    (basically at any time describe all the problems each person is dealing with
    you can click on them to make your choices or just let them play out)
  d the basic idea is to describe problems and put them into the simulation  














1 disease rule change
  a diseases have a resistance factor.  every turn they are on a person/village the village gains resistance to that specific disease
  b occasionally they mutate and the resistance factor lessens
  c resistance factor basically makes them go dormant, they don't do anything for a number of turns
  
  farmer change
  a farmers move to the leader and give or trade like how the other game was
  b farmers produce different goods over time
  c occasionally there is a crop failure
  
  leader change
  a only one leader is the acknowledged leader of a tile (and its a % basis that can be
    eroded or changed like culture
    
(then     
    

1 more statistical designs
 a eventually lets say 50% should be covered with farms
 b small leaders each defend and patrol their own areas
 c they deal with a number of different criseses (disease breakouts, bandits, crop failure, etc)
 d farms produce fruit and then farmers move to the center tile which can be clicked on to view a town
 e as a long term thing leaders can create giant empires in rare circumstances
 d areas develop their own culture/tech/etc


1 first choice
  a a wild man is terrorizing the local trappers
  b should we send a temple prostitute or the local strongman?  
    send the prostitute (do some gilgamesh lines) 
    send the strongman (the two fight and the strongman dies, but they overcome the wildman with numbers) 
  c what to do about the local strongman?  (get him an equal / try to organize against him) 
  d disease has claimed the wildman (do we curse civilization, or accept disease as consequences)
  e all of these are not interconnected  

2 second choice
  first written code of laws (give choices and one is a right and the other is a wrong choices
  
3 third choice
  modern religion, why it exists  

1 hunters fight each other more (set default conflict)
2 add a few choices
3 start in earnest on the world (ie choices are interesting, thought provoking, and illuminating)
4 do the stuff to allow for a victory

#1 realistic distribution of villages  
#  a village planters seek out fishes (and eventually maybe super fertile spots)
#  b they wait until the character is within a certain distance
  
2 fix the farmer action to do something

3 tweak to make leaders dominate
  a once a leader is formed the growth should increase due to decrease in banditry
  b then leaders fight amongst themselves for supremacy (final goal)
  c victory when all leaders have been beaten by yours (or disease or whatever)?

1 choice rule
  a list of choices (question, answer 1, answer 2, object of stats to change, turn to enable, potential action to run)
  b 

2 non choice tech rule
  a create distributions of copper and tin
  b miners come out and use copper and tin
  c if they have both then bronze is potentially formed
  d cultural centers then send out people to sieze tin deposits



1 prostitution choice
  a all choices come in on one population
    and split off from that population. all populations make a random choice when
    you make your choice.  At some point there will be choices to merge with or
	fight leaders.  Merging gives some of your and their stats randomly and you take control
  c -to conflict +to disease
  b - to conflict - to disease
  c +to conflict , conflict can increase population
  d +to conflict damage
  e + to growth + to conflict   
  f - to disease - to growth
  g

1 disease option
  a lower means disease has a less chance of spreading, higher means higher
2 choices and technologies
  a prostitution (lets call it temple maiden)
  b masturbation
  c slavery
  d heirarchy
  e patriarchial society
  f fundamentalism
  g shamanism
  h city religion
  i homophobia (promotes disease resistance with minor societal effects
  j unification/splitting
3 non choice technologies
  a these alter your choices over time
  b copper
  c bronze
  d advanced trade networks  

1 rewrite disease to have a lower chance of of killing when low, higher when high
2 think about some visual effects for disease (can turn off or on)
  a do a popup with disease looking on transfer to the transferee

1 disease
  a randomly gets created on a certain year on a certain person
  b it then spreads and has dormancy/flare ups
  c it has a death rate which can drastically exceed population rates
  d traits start getting selected for that resist disease 
  (trait x has +1 fundamentalism and +1 disease resistance, over time these build up when population hurt from disease, and lower when pop is high)
  e smallpox is a completely devistating disease that drastically alters the course of the game
  
3 reverse conflict and add a few additional options (disease, trade, speed of tech growth(ie both faster techs and more buildings faster)

#1 finish time segment
#2 let play and watch leaders form and wipe out the indegenouspopulation 

1 put a time restriction on when things start happening
  a have a series of times and a series of increments for them
  b put up a counter with the time
    1 put it next to the pause button (where the item list was)

3 leader updates
  a the leader gains population on every successful move (up to a limit of 100)
  b 

2 historical updates 
  a start in middle paleolithic
  b seed with a number of hunter/gatherers
  c move to neolithic and thus farming


  
3 winning farms
  a up   
1 create some more defaults to do a generic progression
  #a lower chance of bandit being created
  #b same with leader
  c same with






1 finish leader comments
  types of leaders
  a gang leader 
  b monarchy
  
  
2 disease
  a diseases are living things that spread and potentially kill
  b after a number of turns smallpox appears and decimates everyone that contacts it
  c techs start being gained to deal with smallpox
3 more animals
  a most animals appear and dissapear (the idea being that they aren't absolutely gigantic like the herds of large grazing animals)
  b snakes pop up out of marshlands, do a little damange and then go back to them and dissapear
  c lions pop up on grasslands and attack herds (or people)
4 more techs
  a copper 1+ to damage  
  b bronze 1+ more to damage and the creation of long distance trade routes  

5 choices
  a much like the trading logic you are given choices to make which have an effect of some sort
    
4 add flavor (disease, more animals, more techs like copper, etc)  

1 make the farms spawn a lot
2 write the code that creates leaders/bandits/shepherds/etc
3 leaders carve out kingdoms through force
 technology to sacrifice a maiden to marauders



1 page that pulls down all the associated jsons and gets the one with the right name
2 it then picks out the few properties we want to set and pulls them out like how edit json does
3 successful posts go back to edit json to save
4 it also has a play game link
5 it requires a login and points to the correct game to build, to make a single experience, the url is game1 and it should
  be shown for feedback




1 give the random, but set chance for fishing vs hunting

3 have the randomly created farmers
4 do the farmer village logic while having hunters gradually be displaced


1 make the gaining of population follow the curve of easy to hard
2 make fishing check if next to fish and show a "fail" if not
3 make hunting use check to make a fail symbol on the hunter and the sheep
4 add the technology restraint on farmland

1 

5 (add some logic that allows to make the farmland immediately occur and be rapid
6


1 shepherding
  a if low move from farm
  b pull cow population into farm
  c domesticated cows move around farm in open grass spots

2 splitting
  #a small chance of creating a population that is a new population
  #b gathering provides 50% of the food needs (and is low on desert)
  #c returned food adds food to the main pop and the gathering process uses it as well
  #d if a main population gets low enough it will dissapear

3 activist farms
  a farms develop centers like the splits
  b shepherds pull from neighboring farms
  c farms quarrel and the center develops fighters that take some food and temporarily quell antisocial behavior
  d farms also produce fishermen
  
4 pottery
  a farms get a boost to max pop
  
5 copper
  a farm warriors get a boost to attack
  b conflict gives a random chance of two pops with a different home fighting (initially each farm has a home, but then you get additional homes for more complex and less conflict)
  c farms have the advantage due to a higher pop with pottery and copper
  d but hunter/gatherers still exist in wooded areas
  e some shepherds break off and permanently live in arid regions
6 tin
  a when the technology tin is researched it is revealed on the map (there is an item of tin, and an amount of tin)
  b after tin is found the population center that gained the technology sends miners to it
  c that population gains an additional attack bonus
7 collapse
  a tin runs out (it simply has an amount and becomes harder to mine)
  b complex populations in cities are reduced (priest/blacksmith/artist/fighter)
  c blacksmith gained wealth by selling bronze tools which supported the rest
8 iron age
  a iron replaces tin
  b but there are a lot more iron spots so miners are closer  
9 disease
  a smallpox is created and it devistates everything (on touch it spreads and reduces the pop by 80%) 
  b cities are permanently lessened in population
  c associated disease resistant techs are formed
  d monogamy,opposition to sex for pleasure, obsession with cleanliness, aversion to outsiders (each reduce the effect of smallpox)
  e when a disease is created shepherds have a small chance of bringing it to a farm
  f each uninfected population has a chance of being infected
  g infected populations rapidly gain new traits to deal with disease resistance and lose a lot of people
    (ie natural resistance, fear of people and the higher the number of the trait the more resistance and the
     more potential for personality changes
10 add lots of little techs that give a lot of background, but aren't too important
   a shinto religious pratices
   b prostitution (temple prostitutes
   c slavery
   d hammurabi's code
   e moral prescriptions
   f stories  
  
1 finish farmer function
  #a make farmer first move to any other farms
  #b test
2 bronze age collapse
  a animal husbandry (shepherding)
  b pottery (boost to pop)
  c copper (boost to attack)
  d tin (creation of bronze, first long distance mining)
  e collapse 
    1 outsiders are seperate and do not participate in bronze culture due to lack of tin
    2 tin supplies run out
    3 people leave cities as the lack of tin reduces opportunity
    
3 iron age
  a more complex interactions
  b specific distinguishing cultures that fight, grow, and die, and get hit by disease and such    
1 pull the two things off into functions
2 create a farmer function based off of the village rule idea
3

1 put techincrement in peoplerule execute
  a check techs against turns and randomly assign tech if ready
2 put population and splitting in peoplerule
  a the population splits off into specialists fishers/hunters/shepherds/etc
  b if a specialist gets too far away it can start its own new population
  c and populations can merge/fight/interact
      

#1 commit everything
2 delete everything not relevant to initial fishing and hunting
3 simplify tech (initial fishing and hunting that control chance of occurring)
4 create differentiating cultures (each pop has its own culture. It also maintains a list of cultures it has contact with)
5 introduce territory tech after a certain amount of turns (when moving to a spot mark it, favor random movement on spots already marked)
6 introduce items tech (split off populations inside the main one, these have a subordinate type and move to resources and make items)
7 introduce shepherding tech (these are like items, but they hold cows and seek out wheat and occasionally join back up)
8 introduce farm tech ( these split off permanently and grow food)

1 do shepherds
  a move to cow
  b split off a few cows
  c move back to farm with food
  d (eventually tech increases make the shepherd start out with cows and a large amount
     showing a seperate breed of domesticated cows)
2 do bandit code
  a bandit moves to neighboring farms and take some food
  b then it moves back to its home
3 do warrior code
  a warrior moves to each farm and has a 10% chance of killing bandits
4 do merchant code
5 test all of the above



1 write code that adds population to farms,etc
2 iterate through those populations and runs them
  a list of all pops
  b based on type, determine how to increment and whether to create
  c write a method that takes a pop, adds the right oobject, and lets it run

1 bronze age - after agriculture
  a tin resources are discovered
  b pepper, frankensence, gold, silver traded
  c minoan culture as a potential tree
  d bronze age collapse.  
    1 technologies that allow for cities to be expanded, but eventually are counterproductive
       a basically merit that turns into heirarchy and then creates bad leaders who disrupt the system and make bad choices
    2 natural disasters that disrupt complex systems
    3 warfare changes, (ie nobles use chariots, but then another group develops swords and dominates everyone else while decimating them
  e research literature and combine into techs, (mostly scattered and random, but combine by culture)
    1 moral precepts
    2 stories
    3 specific events (like the creation of a sorcerer that damages crops, two nations send disputes, etc

2 iron age
  a pick the different dynasties and cultures
  b add more items and a larger variety
1 do basic technologies and timelines to show proper thoughts
2 do more advanced technologies with some very basic stat effects
3 focus on creating a tech tree to show technologies over time



1 disease
  a diseases randomly start and spread
  b they cause fundamentalism to spread and activities to alter
  
2 flooding
  a very libertarian culture
  b floods start the progression of progressivism  

3 show tech lists that then represent how the cities deal with the world.


2 leave in card game elements and make them some random things with storyline elements
  (very basic to start with, focus on simulation)
  a basically its like tetris where things will happen, but you have basic optional controls

1  village rule will take care of this era's techs
  a when this era is entered the people rule still is run
  b the village rule then starts to create villages in appropriate spots
    based on the people rule that already exist
  c more villages can be created over time based on existing villages
2 initially when settled a few farms and a tax man is created
  a over time based on techs the farms expand and the tax man visits them too
  b based on techs the farms generate basic items and cities have a more complex
    set they can build which in turn helps warriors/farmers/traders
3 in response to bandrity or other attacks on farms warriors start being created
  a warriors initally just patrol and defend 
4 if there are other villages then traders automatically come by and take and give extra
  unneeded items
5 farmers create bandits, especially if they are suffering in some way
  a bandits raid farms
  b if they raid a neighboring civ then they can provoke them
  c if they raid farms they provoke warriors
6 one of the techs allows civilizations to convert the remaining hunters (fishers convert easily)
  a they send out temple prostitutes (not called that, pick some ancient sounding name)
  b those bring back some of the population and make them more likely to convert wholesale
7 various catastrophies can happen which get prevented by items and techs
  a disease
  b flooding (rain)
  c earthquake (can be lessened with proper buildings)  
  d animal attacks     
    
8 once all that is done then add some differentiation techs

2 agriculture
  a once settle tech is ready a village is created
  b bronze weapons 
  c villages create subordinate populations
    1 warriors
    2 tax men
    3 traders
  d likewise farms are created around the villages
3 subordinate populations
  a warriors patrol and fight bandits or attack other civilizations  
  b tax men move to farms and gather coin/items
  c traders seek out neighboring civilizations or specific important resources
4 friendlyness of neighbors
  a civilizatios are friendly, but will eventually fight when they bump up against each other
  b normally the fights are small and low level, but they can become bigger (ie
     normal fighting is a farm creating a population that attacks another farm, opposing civ
     can potentially up the scale of the retaliation and start a war)
5 traders, when not in war go out and produce beneficial trade.
  a beneficial trade is basically a more even distribution of items
  b cities are stronger when they have a more even distribution (ie they benefit from 10 of
  something, they use it and 11 doesn't help them any more)
6 tax men gather items for the cities
  a a civ has an inherent greediness tech set by variablility that sets how it does
  b if it misuses its farmers it will be weaker and be behind other civs
  c losing a war can change variability
  
           
  
  
3 iron age
  more techs that mostly just affect things rather than change them substatially  

1 trading section
  a reveal resources when the appropriate trading technology is researched
  b on next to another group of people either trade or conflict and give the appropriate increment
  c use the opposite thing to determine which is more likely
  d create an image of the items being traded (just flash the most owned item to start)
  e on high trading occasionally move to a resource to deplete that trade item (they are random in location, and only show if wheat isn't there)
  f if high in trade and conflict then that population will suppliment its conflicts with slaves

1 start off with initial techs.
2 rules that allow techs to increase over time, and for the necessity of
  interaction to increase different techs
  a techs start at one and by default follow the formula of large early gains and less later
    (use efficency formula created)
  b techs increment over time to +1 for every era assuming the right state
    (first is fishing vs hunting, second is trading vs conflict, third is agriculture vs hunting)
  c cross polination increases states
    (on conflict or trade when available do cross poliniation)
3 up till agriculture and then bronze age
  those start to show subtle differences and colorful people

#1 remove sucess hunting and make fishing limited (with gathering on failure)
2 put currently researched tech (at least the type) in an overlay on the person
3 on successfull researched do the popup
4 expand out the states so that it is difficult for a single population to do all the techs
   a hunting states
   b fishing states
5 add on trade and conflict the chance to transfer some research if there is a large lack on
  one side
  
  

1 create a tech under hunting called follow the herd which requires a minimum amount of hunting
  and then can be researched.
  It says "if a successful hunt, then next fishing chance is ignored
  

1 in genera preferences have a thing for how fast the techs research (by default fast)
2 techs give a chance of different preferences with some having a high variablity like hunting or fishing.
3 combat can destroy a group

1 tech maxes and mins are defined with a random component
  a on increment when creating a new tech do a + or minus 3 random
  
2

1 increment random tech and display a popup on a successful tech
2 make the techs each increase a stat or change something
  a barter creates trade spots which people occasionally visit
  b jewelry,pigments,etc put down places where items can be mined/created
  c other things create lists of items that can be traded and alter statistics
  d on a trade/combat the crappier culture gets a tech boost.
3 make sure huntingvs fishing and etc work
4 

1 make the growth function quickly at the beginning and then have great difficulty 
 #approaching the split point
  #pop/maxpop = inefficency
  #growth=growth -inefficency * growth 
  
2 make sure that fishing can only hit fish and hunting cannot 
3 see exactly why combat isn't happening 

4 add second era (with appropriate fanfaire
5 remove the ok box for clicking on a unit and make sure that clicks can follow people
  (eventually a small box will appear graphically showing what is going on with those people, periodically refreshed)
  

#1 single tech with right properties will go up or down
#  (this never stops and is associated with the state)
#2 other techs will randomly increment
  (create an explanation bar that follows the person and shows you their techs
3 techs add items
4 adding fish to show good fishing spots

1 initially the key techs are picked and reinforced (or not, if they fail)
2 other techs move up by a gradual progression (one is picked and it gradually goes up, and these go up faster by tech transfers)

The people go through the different eras with bonuses based on the techs and a richer world than currently (disease, more animals, etc)
for example on preserved meat hunting/fishing produces lasting food that gets eaten and boosts the pop
all of those techs simply increase over time and are reinforcing 
a new era happens when all the previous techs are fully researched

1 a few key techs that can alternate and have wide ranging effects (so you might have 30 hunting and 10 fishing or 39 fishing and 1 hunting
  a hunting
  b fishing ( add fish in and have their populations deplete/increase, otherwise fishing yields are low like gathering)
                         (on the invention of agriculture hunting can become sheperding and fishing can become farming)
  a combat (chance of fighting when close)
  b trade ( when close it shows two gold icons instead of swords and item amounts change hands
  
  
  a liberalization (removed restrictions
  b fundamentalism (added restrictions that stop disease and have slight negatives on productivity)
  
2 general technologies that simply grow over time



1 freeze 3 techs
2 run 180 turns.  If split or higher pop then keep frozen and freeze 3 more (if none available then just pick some)
3 if the time for an era to come has passed then move to the next era on the freeze choice 

1 add religious techs	

1 basically techs allow for long term changes to individuals
  a long term hunting/gathering for the initial era
  b second era has the beginnings of trade (including seeking out areas to resource gather and trade
  c then more items to trade
  d domesticated dog (and each era is gradually entered into, and represented by clicking)
2 agriculture
  a eventually the agricultural society forms in fertile areas
  b it spreads as tech improves
  c fundamentalism vs liberalism become big things and the initial tribal religon changes
3 copper
4 bronze age
5 iron age
6 ancient history    


4 test the incrementing of technologies
  a break structure into era and state (the techs all go into a map, but there is a structure with the names)
  a break out incrementing further (hunting is its own state, in addition to general)
  b create a mapped relation that allows the correct randomness
5 the era logic for enabling new techs for people (transferring is seperate)


1 share latest
  a add the ability to rename and add a description for the shared
  b put the shared at the bottom of the gamelist
  
2 push current big map up
3 put the pincrement for hunting into a tech and push it up, test different amounts
  and an additional option of avoiding completely killing a population 
  
6  
  
2 add two societal tech trees
  a fundamentalism
  b tribalism
  fundamentalism has a list of techs from the bible
  tribalism has a list of techs from the shinto religion (look at old tech rule)
  
  use the big world map to add the different areas (some which have different animals
  diseases and so on)  fundamental techs all promote disease resistance.  tribal techs
  promote a general cross section of techs (combat fighting and avoiding it, organized society,
  planning ahead, etc).  The fundamental techs do too, but just to a lesser extent with
  disease resistance becoming a huge factor.
    a swampy area in the middle (patches of swamp and grass)
    b grassy at the bottom
    c desert at the top (with isolated grassy in the northwest and a river in the northeast)
    snakes,alligators are in the swampy area (they respawn low health if killed off and 
    gain health in the swampy area, but also alligators can hunt sheep if nearby, snakes
    just kill anything that comes close)
    sheep roam all over
    elephants and lions roam too.  (elephants are basically too tough to be hurt and aren't 
    hunted by anything, lions hunt the sheep and fight with the humans
    
    humans eventually learn how to domesticate sheep.  this gives them a random chance
    of getting various diseases and makes hunting less necessary.
    When a human is diseased it puts itself into a disease state and starts
    losing people and incrementing (or researching new) disease techs
    on interactions between people (combat and otherwise) disease gets spread and
    sticks with a population.
    
    tribalism is bad about combat and grudges, forgiveness is a tech that can replace
    tribalisms combat ideals and it allows further growth
    
    eras are goverend by their own properties (like the amount of time it takes before an
    era can be researched, and maybe other requrirements

Develop a simulation that shows how people define their society in reaction to their environment.

1 inital approach for testing
  a take code in google drive and run it 
  b replace new code till you see issue


#1 write some code that puts techs on each person
#2 make conflict tech
#3 add in only currently used techs
#add increment tech logic
5 ma
4 test

each population has a list of techs which have a chance of increasing when related
actions occur (or just in general there is a random tech that has a small chance of
being created and added, or upgraded)

if a tech is enabled that means that the person starts with it

On the addition of barter and pigments start creating visually unique looks for each
person (start with it added by default to test)

1 goals
  a cultural affectations associated with techs that demonstrate spreading techs
    1 handaxe,spear,dress 
  b a variety of foods, gathering that picks them, and animals that go after one food
  

2 wire the techs up to affect the game in various ways 
  (not all have to be realistic, some aren't really techs, 
  but might be natural disasters or afflictions  


#1 add list of techs in a seperate json data that has the technology key
#  a then test that by running them 
  

1 gui actually only allows changes in technologies (enable,disable,change value)
  techs then run constantly
  a technologies are in a pbase with their name
  b run through all the techs and turn them into a list
  c tapping on the list will pop up something that takes the tech
    values and allows you to edit them
  
2 add some variation in the relative amount of the wheat produced on grass tiles
  so that only some grass tiles will get it  

3 create all the techs, make them individually gained over time and shared,
  try out all the possible combinations
#1 huge version


1 basic actions are there.  Technology only changes the chance of them
 occurring

#1 fishing,gathering,hunting, put overlays on them
2 add random fruits as a part of gathering

#1 add in a property that will make the human not go after the sheep on a certain
#  percentage basis and pick a different one if the health is low
#2 just sheep  (just add a number for sheep and people)
#3 gathering tech
#4 fishing tech
  #a move near water
  #b increase food
  
5 pretty edit is a link
  a add a json data that is a list of buttons/textboxes/etc with name of the variable
    the code recursively searches and finds the variable  and displays it
    on edit you take that list, edit them with the new values and then export
  b there is a buildprettyedit that holds the list of objects that correspond
  c   

1 add in gathering tech (seperate so we can see both)
2 add in fishing tech
3 


1 add in the first tier of techs
  a for each step share a game
  b think about descriptions and names for the game


#1 add a link that posts to leaderboard to share 

#1 create leaderboard and assoc tech
2

1 play with statistics and choices until I have a solid beginning
  a choice between several maps (of differing sizes)
  b


#1 install tortoise svn and continue updating unfuddle (look at old laptop if necessary)


4 offer a link to play the game (and have a share link)

1 use phonegap to deliver first android app
  a take initial stats and allow people to change them and watch the resulting simulation
  b create web frontend with a dozen stats
  c post those stats to the website
  d on start run that game
  e offer a way to share the game on facebook (to start just have a link)
1 try making the space a lot bigger

make the base oobject pick from a list of techs given a random amount for each one
starting techs (eventually add the ability to gain new ones)
1 stick technology (hold stick in hands,greater combat ability)
2 fishing 1 (empty hands, stay near water)
3 hunting (follow cows)
4 gathering (gather food with edible by human trait,move towards that food)
5 fiber (skirts)


#2 slow growth down a lot (like to 1000)
3 wolves that hunt cows and will fight humans if they get too close
4 snakes




1 when technology is developed or transferred create an associated cultural item
2 on split keep the cultural item
3 on potential combat vs trade higher when more culture


1 tech tree
  a based on initial config
  b choices occur inside and are probably just superficial
  c
2 huge base
  a create africa symbolic map
  b each


1 adding back in conflict
  a check to see alignment of culture/tech tree
  b if different and if next to another then
  c do the sword and reduce both populations


1 create action that is breaking nuts
  a move to tree
  b flash the trading image on the person
  
2 hunt animal action
  a on create internal have it randomly create some animals that randomly move around
  b add hunt animal action onto a template

3 action that prepares leather (gathers animal hides, turns it into leather
  a hunt animal
  b change clothing to leather
  
4 action that carves spear
  a go to tree
  b flash trading image
  c add a spear
  
5 fiber
  a go to grass
  b flash trading image
  c extra clothes  


6 fishing 
  a extra food near water
  b use code that makes some water on coastal things (fishing generator)
  c equip spear, move next to water, flash trading image
  
7 huts
  a move to spot
  b flash trading image
  c set down a hut
  
8 cooking
    (after hunt or gather)
  a call fire action
  b next to fire flash a meat action    

9 preserved meats
   a cooking takes longer
   b leftover meat rots slower
10 ritual burial
   a add in small chance of death
   b put a ritual around it (the dancing)
11 modern language
   a add in required techs for other techs
12 barter
   a trade routes start to occur on overmap
   b random chance of person coming in and trading with the designated merchant
   c people can make choices about that barter
  
13 pigments
   a new resource is revealed on map
   b code to make sure new resources are chased after
   c each new resource is tied to a color, clothing colors are tied to that
   d making action for dying clotihng
14 jewelry
   a new resources are revealed on map (next to ocean)
   b new resource + fiber offers jewelry
   c jewelry gets traded (lightweight and high value)
15 music
   a every so often a flute gets created
   b when signing or dancing occurs (random chance) flute music is added
16 slavery
   a increased chance of battle
   b battles are less deadly
   c slaves are traded like any other resource
                 
                 
                 
1 fundamentalism vs liberalism
  a fundamentalism is a technology
    1 fundamentalism increases in response to negative events
    2 it adds a lot of secondary technologies that can be negative or positive
      depending on the situation (disease,conflict, losing in general)
    3 so fundamentalism will end up in outlying areas where the losers of battles go   
  b so is liberalism
    1 liberalism increases over time
    2 it removes fundamentalist rules
    3 so the cities where the winners of the conflict are will be full of liberalism
  c both will wax and wain constantly in response to conflict, disease, and other events            
                 
                  
#1 foodrule
2 a peoplerule that creates the group of people with the right technologies
  to start with
  a it sets all of the templates and actions
  b neither group has any technologies to start with
  c the starting technology also governs the gathering of future techs
    1 there are incremental future techs (ie spear to spear + 10)
      they are gotten over time
    2 there are techs that require the right place, or the right techs
    3 the techs tell the early story of technology growth  
3   

3 one group of people chase after herds and develop technology for doing so, 
  a create some LBs that move next to the cow and then reduce its population
  b they also devote some % of time to gathering
4 the other group of people stay and develop technology near a river for farming.
 Growth is directly goverened by food and if there isn't enough then 
 conflict occurs, the losers split off and try to take over one of the
  smaller in between population groups 
  (they directly fight those and the two merge together and share culture.
   Then these hybrid cultures eventually take over due to advantages in 
   culture and so on and so forth. technology growth occurs mainly in the 
   high population focused areas



basic ideas: 
1 landrule that fills the land with food 
  a every square gets some food (dependent on tile+ little random)
  b if food is above X amount then an image is shown for it
2(also creates migrating herds), 
  a randomly pick spots to place cows
  b those cows search 1 extra tile for food and pick the most 90% of the time
  c

1 start, people with nothing
  a growth+fiber adds some clothing growth+farming adds sickle
  b conflict+ spear adds spear , conflict + armor adds armor
  c initially start out expansionary
  d an initial technology controls 
  

1 story, progression towards cities
  a beer technology leads to a tiny village at 30 growth
     1 which leads to bread technology (growth)
     2 and prostitution (the ability to convert some wild people when they pass nearby)
     3 and bigger cities near rivers (river based techs)
        
  b herding technology allows mobile populations to grow
     1 but it can be transferred to cities
     2 herding leads to disease technologies
         a which depending on disease resistance and culture can wipe out populations
           1 and that leads to disease resistance being increased
           2 and an additional chance of disease resistant techs being adopted
               a fundamentalism (basically techs are rarely given up)
                  1 downside is that not all good techs will be adopted
                  2 upside is that disease resisntant techs have a greater chance
                    (cleanlieness,not eating certain foods, xenophobia, banning prostitution, banning gay sex)
  b fishing technology allows populations to grow extra near mouths of rivers             
  c liberalism ( technologies are frequently given up to make more room)
    1         

  d populations transfer people and start to gain identites
    1 one city might have a lot of growth-conflict populations (grow, seek conflict)
    2 there are a few populations that simply avoid all others (low growth technologies, no city tech)
    3 some cities might have a lot of growth-expand and a few conflict
  e city techs start becoming based off of specific acquired resources
  
1 self reinforcing behavior 
  a techs that control behavior
    1 seek out conflict (look one tile ahead and go towards)
    2 seek out growth (ie stay on good tiles)
      a additionally activate growth technologies
    3 avoid others (look one tile ahead and go the other way)
    4 (these can combine so that you might have one that seeks out conflict, then seeks out growth
    
  b techs that can be tied to other technologies
    1 a tech has a chance of creating a third technology that contains
      two techs (and is appropriately named tech1-tech2)


3 slow things down a little to watch

#1 on splitting split one tech off to only one group
2 on conflict a tech has a small chance of being transferred
3 put in more shinto techs and make sure that that makes the assortment more random
4 visual representation of technologies
agriculture
5 liberalism promotes freedom type techs
6 fundamentalism promotes rule type techs
7 city based techs vastly increase wealth and so on, but are more dependent and can fall apart
8 the progression to higher cities should be randomly adding techs that sometimes work together and sometimes don't
  with many failed cities along the way ( including events that disrupt things) so for example you have
  a dozen populations in a mutually benificial relationship, one of them gets disrupted in its tech
  and then they all fall apart


#Culture have 5 main technology slots
The technology slots then influence behavior (fishing for example tend to move along the water)
                                             (strong technologies encourgage fighting)
                                             (growth technologies encourage growth)
                                            (there might be a favor desert tech for example)
                                             
#the number of each technology then gets constantly reported on the side
#  a add code to clear out the tech every iteration
#  b 
Choices on clicking allow you to influence those technology slots
Each cultural technology gets represented differently when going into an area
                                             
Technologies are explained from the perspective of the tribal people in words and voices when clicked on
They are also reactive random technologies get added or changed over time and become more useful
for example disease gets more potent with liberalism and population, fundamentalism then has a protective
effect.  The best way to describe it is that guns germs and steel describe why the west won.  This
describes the ebb and flow.  The creation of cities, the creation of complex technologies and the
backwards slide when disease hits or things change.  Liberalism's weakness is its lack of rules leads
to negative technologies having an uncontrolled effect.  Fundamentalism's is that it keeps on adding
rules until the negative rules destroy the society.  (you have other things like machiveli's the pursuit of power)

1 start representing different cultural technologies
2 add in some choices

if population more than 1 add in a question "should we fight?" and they fight and then the results are
reported

1 pick one trait and make them all similar for each population

1 different clothing, different populations
2 initial hunt/gather templates (and then move off)
3 village 

do this while working on stuff

1 randomly add a technology every 100 turns to a population

1 put technologies into the different rule parts
  a total pop
  b growth
  c conflict
  d every x turns it build up statistics for that pop-
    each one gets called off of the population to do the appropriate actions
    
  
 
2 replace the different spots with technology
3 do the random generated builder


The different parts of building a 2d game in GWT. Loading images, writing to the canvas, adding in small visual cues, and other general issues with building a game in Java.

Current story
  a starts out one hunter gatherer
  b population grows, populations split at about 20 people
    a default technology of shaman that bands together 
    b technology grabs each % technology of population and then updates the growth amount (this happens every 10 turns)
    
  c each good technology adds a little to the total amount and slightly alters behavior
    1 add 10 positive technologies and 5 negative ones(they already exist and will increase or decrease in percent and have the resulting effects)
    2 add fundamentalism vs liberalism technologies
    3 add in a question that speaks to fundamentalism or liberalism
    
    
  d dramatic increase in population on advent of agriculture
  e cities and towns and the associated specialization.


Impermanent technology
  a all technologies are a double.
  b a certain amount either go up or down based on the current trajectory of the population
  c events can cause major shifts
  d major technologies guide the trajectory (fundamentalism increases things like aversion to homosexuality
    and give those technologies some of their power)

Conflict
  a add more negative technologies
  b make technologies mostly impermanent and on a percentage base.
  c 
  the conflict comes from which technology you have to prioritize.  When you click on a population
  it will give you a choice to respond to a series of events.  If you choose to then that population
  will prioritize those technologies and will compete against the other populations, but also merge
  with them.  When you watch them they should grow and alter according to the culture you have
  given them.  
  The second idea for conflict is that the first one is too rewarding.  The second one will be all about
  properly managing people.  You will have crises that test your social reaction and those will
  simply hurt the populace if you do badly on them.  For example your child acts out, you discipline 
  them or you don't depending on the situation.  You are given a leadership role and you decide how
  controlling you want to be.  You act in an unfair way giving your family an advantage
  basically negative technologies can be developed, can be gained after a disaster, or just over time.
  By going in and handling those situations you maintain the populations and provide for a more helping
  hand.
  

1 technology
  a technology changes increase the total growth ability for 

1 make population set a marker for different pops (name + counter on pop which gets set to all lbs
2 make the clothing one set different clothing
  a randomly assign some pieces of clothing to a specific population (eventually tie with images)

2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
  a if fishing tech is researched the fishing template is added
  b put some animals down
  c put some fruits down
  d look for the gathering action, assign it to some
  e look for hunting action
  
  

5 add in code that gives a random chance of a scenario occurring
1 movement,growth, etc are all based on the tech tree


#1 use a method that clears out the htmlout to display the new stuff
#2 test and iterate







1 test some more and identify errors
2 



1 add in code to make population add people
2 and assign basic hunter gatherer roles
3 add in code to set the clothing
4 make sure fishing works correctly
5 




1 goal is hundreds of random scenarios of unusual situations
2 based on nonstandard myths and dungeon crawl images
3 (initially random with maybe a few choices and chances, can do a tech tree later)


1 on click create a fmd at 0,1
  a take what is in the hmd and create the FMD
  b it is created through the selection thing (with maybe additional changes depending on the gate)
  c clicking on the town
  d make it so that both the town and the person are written

2 technology introduces more complicated interactions

1 lower the initial growth rate and max pop to encourage dividing

1 tall symbolic map of africa
2 growth/conflict/etc work off of it
3 on clicking a tile create the fmd and only run the currently clicked one (if already exists remove the map part and recreate)


1 conflict has a small chance of creating a city given the circumstances
  a conflict holds a create city rule (to start with it is just internal)
  b if the population is at max run
  c if the amount created is max then create no more and go on
  d if next to water then 10% chance (and can't be too near another city)
  e on creation add a city capacity under the total pop key to nearby tiles
  
2 add extra movement when not near a city, essentially making those pops nomadic  
  
  
3 Alter growth rule
  a basically some changes to growth based on randomness and events
  b if population in tile then small chance of reducing growth
  c if below normal growth and no population small chance of increasing growth (and this could be changed by tech)
    

1 cities have a high total pop limit
2 everywhere else doesn't
3 low amounts of pop outside of cities and frequent moving

1 when a conflict occurs show it, if it is clicked on create
  a scene of the two sides fighting
2 clicking on the city will show the city and have options appear
  (trades, and choices, doing well will speed growth, poorly will slow growth)
  
3 otherwise clicking on a tile with a small population will show a couple
 farms
 (though you could specialized the pops and have other scenes appear
